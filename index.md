## About Me

I completed my Ph.D. in Organizational Psychology at Michigan State University in 2025. My research broadly is concerned with the use of computational approaches to understanding people's individual differences, team dynamics, and the interplay between them to paint a richer picture of how groups work. I am also interested in leveraging technological approaches to psychological research, ranging from working with digital trace data and unobtrusive measures (e.g., audio transcripts, computer-tracked decision-making) to leveraging game environments to measure granular team behaviors (e.g., using Counter Strike to study human-AI teaming). 

## Research Interests

- **Team Dynamics:** team cognition, coordination processes, team composition, expert/interdisciplinary teams, e-sports and virtual team environments, human-AI teaming
- **Personality and Individual Differences:** five-factor model, openness to experience, personality structure, assessment development
- **Computational Social Science:** digital trace data and log analysis, artificial intelligence augmenting team and individual knowledge retrieval, using large language models and neural transformer architectures to examine psychological construct validity
- **Methods:** natural language processing (NLP), social network analysis (SNA), factor analysis, linear and logistic regression, survey design
- **Programming and Other Tools:** R, Python, Grafana (SQL), Google Vertex AI

## News

- **[July 2025]** As of the beginning of July, I have started a new position as a People Scientist in the People Science team at Roblox! I'm excited to apply my I-O expertise and scientific thinking on a team working on cutting edge problems, focusing on methodology for LLM/AI evaluation in the workplace.

- **[May 2025]** Excited to announce that I officially defended my dissertation on May 30th, titled "Estimating the Accuracy of Team Mental Models Through Transition-Phase Information-Sharing: A Neural Graph Matching Approach"! In this research, I applied modern neural network NLP techniques to the task of measuring dynamic information networks from team communications. Many thanks to my advisors Dr. Dorothy Carter and Dr. Christopher Nye, along with my committee members Dr. Kevin Hoff and Dr. Nathan Carter. I'm also incredibly grateful to my friends and family who supported me throughout my research.
